# Individual Google Sheets System - Complete Implementation

## 🎉 System Overview

The recruitment system now creates **individual Google Sheets for each job** in your shared drive, with separate tabs for each interview round. This provides better organization and isolation compared to the previous single-sheet approach.

## ✅ What's Working

### 1. **Individual Sheet Creation**
- ✅ Creates a new Google Sheet for each job
- ✅ Places sheets directly in your shared drive (`0AFFcPXsmbiTcUk9PVA`)
- ✅ Uses Drive API to bypass service account limitations
- ✅ Automatic tab creation for each interview round
- ✅ Color-coded tabs for better visual organization

### 2. **Smart Tab Structure**
- **Format**: `Round_X_RoundName` (e.g., `Round_1_Technical_Screening`)
- **First Round**: Name, Email, Status, Interviewers, Time Scheduled, [Evaluation Parameters], Feedback, Rejection Reason
- **Subsequent Rounds**: Adds Resume Link and Work Experience & Skills Summary columns
- **Automatic Headers**: Based on evaluation parameters defined for each round

### 3. **Candidate Sync System**
- ✅ Real-time sync to individual job sheets
- ✅ Proper evaluation score formatting (e.g., "8/10")
- ✅ Status-based sorting (fresh → in_progress → scheduled → completed → accepted → rejected)
- ✅ Queue-based system with rate limiting and error handling
- ✅ Works with job's individual sheet ID instead of main sheet

### 4. **Database Integration**
- ✅ Stores individual sheet ID in `jobs.sheet_id`
- ✅ Stores individual tab URLs in `interview_rounds.sheet_url`
- ✅ Proper cleanup when jobs are deleted (moves sheet to trash)

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)
```
GOOGLE_CLOUD_KEY_FILE=./key.json
GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=0AFFcPXsmbiTcUk9PVA  # Shared Drive ID
```

### Service Account Setup
- ✅ Service account: `service-acc1@aitf-474614.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- ✅ Shared drive access with Editor permissions
- ✅ Google Sheets and Drive API scopes enabled

## 📋 How It Works

### Job Creation Flow
1. **Frontend** → Creates job with rounds via API
2. **Backend** → Calls `createRecruitmentSheet(jobName, rounds)`
3. **Drive API** → Creates spreadsheet directly in shared drive
4. **Sheets API** → Sets up tabs and headers for each round
5. **Database** → Stores sheet ID and tab URLs

### Candidate Sync Flow
1. **Candidate Status Change** → Triggers sync via `SheetSyncService`
2. **Database Query** → Gets job's sheet ID and round info
3. **Sheet Update** → Uses `updateCandidateInRoundSheet(sheetId, tabName, data)`
4. **Smart Sorting** → Sorts by status priority and scheduled time

## 🚀 Key Features

### Individual Sheet Benefits
- **Better Organization**: Each job has its own dedicated sheet
- **Easier Sharing**: Share specific job sheets with relevant stakeholders
- **No Clutter**: No mixing of different jobs in one sheet
- **Scalability**: No limit on number of jobs or tabs per job

### Smart Tab Management
- **Automatic Setup**: Tabs created based on interview rounds
- **Proper Headers**: Dynamic columns based on evaluation parameters
- **Visual Coding**: Color-coded tabs for easy identification
- **URL Tracking**: Direct links to specific round tabs

### Robust Sync System
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate sync when candidate status changes
- **Error Handling**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents API quota issues
- **Queue Management**: Handles concurrent updates gracefully

## 📊 Sheet Structure Example

For a job "Software Engineer Position" with 2 rounds:

**Sheet Name**: `Software_Engineer_Position_2025_Recruitment`
**Location**: Shared Drive (`0AFFcPXsmbiTcUk9PVA`)

**Tab 1**: `Round_1_Technical_Screening`
```
Name | Email | Status | Interviewers | Time Scheduled | Coding Skills | Problem Solving | Feedback | Rejection Reason
```

**Tab 2**: `Round_2_System_Design`
```
Name | Email | Resume Link | Work Experience | Status | Interviewers | Time Scheduled | Architecture | Scalability | Feedback | Rejection Reason
```

## 🧪 Testing Commands

```bash
# Test individual sheet creation
node test-individual-sheet-creation.js

# Test complete system (creation + candidate sync)
node test-complete-system.js

# Test shared drive access
node test-shared-drive.js

# Manual sync all candidates to their individual sheets
node manual-sync.js real
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Sheet creation failed"** - Check shared drive permissions
2. **"Tab not found"** - Verify job has sheet_id in database
3. **"Permission denied"** - Ensure service account has Editor access to shared drive

### Verification Steps
1. Check if sheet appears in shared drive
2. Verify sheet has correct tabs for each round
3. Confirm candidates sync to correct tabs
4. Test evaluation score formatting

## 📈 Performance & Limits

- **Creation Time**: ~2-3 seconds per job sheet
- **Sync Speed**: ~800ms between API calls (rate limiting)
- **Concurrent Jobs**: No practical limit
- **Sheet Size**: Google Sheets limit (10 million cells per sheet)

## 🎯 Next Steps

The system is now production-ready! When you create jobs through your frontend:

1. **Individual sheets** will be automatically created in your shared drive
2. **Candidates** will sync to their respective job sheets and round tabs
3. **Evaluation scores** will be properly formatted and displayed
4. **Status changes** will trigger real-time updates

The system provides the individual sheet organization you requested while maintaining all the robust sync and management features of the original system.
